# React OpenLayers Fiber

`@react-ol/fiber` is a react renderer for OpenLayers https://openlayers.org/ .

It is based on the same concept as `@react-three/fiber` for Three.js.

## What does it look like?

```tsx
import React from "react";
import "ol/ol.css";
import { Map } from "@react-ol/fiber";

export const Example = () => (
  <Map>
    <olView initialCenter={[0, 0]} initialZoom={2} />
    <olLayerTile preload={Infinity}>
      <olSourceOSM />
    </olLayerTile>
  </Map>
);
```

import React from "react";
import "ol/ol.css";
import { Map } from "@react-ol/fiber";

export const Example = () => (
  <Map className="rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-4">
    <olView initialCenter={[0, 0]} initialZoom={2} />
    <olLayerTile preload={Infinity}>
      <olSourceOSM />
    </olLayerTile>
  </Map>
);

<Example />

## Why?

Build your maps declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can tap into React's ecosystem.

### Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in OpenLayers will work here without exception.

### Can it keep up with frequent updates to OpenLayers?

Yes. There is no hard dependency on a particular OpenLayers version, it does not wrap or duplicate a single OpenLayers class. It merely expresses OpenLayers in JSX: `<olView />` becomes `new ol.View()`, and that happens dynamically.

### Is it slower than plain OpenLayers?

No. There is no additional overhead. Components participate in a unified renderloop outside of React. It outperforms OpenLayers at scale due to React's scheduling abilities.
